# README.md
*This Cookbook is meant to be a written collection of guides, and a private storage of example-files and commands. It is not meant to be exhaustive by any means. Much of what will be written will be a retelling of official documents and various guides found online. It is to be used as reference. This repo will grow as my knowledge base and exposure to resources expands.*
