This Repo is meant to be a private storage of examples and commands of various coding language and design. It is not exhaustive by any means. It is to be used as reference.

Being in the initial stages of this project, this will also serve as a type of git practice. Changes will be made to this file and others as my knowledge base and exposure to resources expands.
